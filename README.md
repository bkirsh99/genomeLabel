What is genomeLabel?
======
**genomeLabel** is a command line tool for the fully automated generation of genomic label data that can be summarized into statistically relevant information and visualized in a genome browser, tab-separated tables, and plots.
The labels annotate the genome both structurally and functionally, providing insight into the potentially regulatory role of certain regions via colocalization analysis methods.

The genomeLabel tool is implemented in **Perl and Python** and automatically executes commands provided by **bedtools and bedops** to annotate the Genome Reference Consortium Human Build 38 **(hg38)** assembly. Integration with **[GIGGLE](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4556)** further expands the functionality of genomeLabel to identifying and ranking the significance of genomic loci shared between query features and thousands of genome interval files present in the *giggle_files* directory.

For display by the UCSC Genome Browser, a script 'makeHubs.pl' can be used. Hoewever, assembly hubs need to be hosted on a publicly accessible web server provided by the user.

Background:
------
## Genome Annonation:
Annotating the genome can be broken down into three main steps: (1) identifying portions of the genome that do not code for proteins, (2) identifying elements on the genome, a process called *gene prediction*, and (3) attaching biological information to these elements. This yields two types of annotation:

**1) Structural Annotation -** Identifying elements in the genome (i.e. exons, introns, UTRs, CDSs, etc.)

**2) Functional Annotation -** Attaching biological information to the elements in the genome (e.g. biochemical product, regulatory role, expression, etc.)

Thus, the output of genomeLabel tool combines structural (exon, intron, intergenic, etc.) and putative functional (promoter, enhancer, TF binding site, repetitive sequence, etc.) annotation. 

Data:
------
This program takes in annotation data from genomic databases as input to generate custom label tracks.

Usage:
------
```bash

genomeLabel - A tool to  annotate the genomic features within a given region and work with the contents thereof to produce genome browser tracks and compute summary statistics.

SYNOPSIS
	USAGE: ./run.pl [chr:start-stop] --biotype [BIOTYPE] --path [/PATH/] <command(s)> <filter(s)>
	
	SAMPLE CALLS:
	./run.pl chrX:15200000-15800000 --biotype gm12878 --path /home/bkirsh/
		
	./run.pl chrX:15200000-15800000 --biotype GM12878 --path /home/bkirsh/ --repeat LINE --regulator GATA2
	
	./run.pl chrX:15200000-15800000 --biotype huvec --path /home/bkirsh/ --repeat LINE,L2,SINE --regulator GATA2
	
	The program accepts any of the following six human cell, tissue, or DNA sample used by the ENCODE Consortium:
		GM12878, H1-hESC, K562, HeLa-S3, HepG2, and HUVEC.
	A description of these samples is available at http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgEncodeVocab?term=GM12878,K562,H1-hESC,HeLa-S3,HepG2,HUVEC.
	This option is case- and delimiter-insensitive, and inputs such as H1HESC, helas3, and HEp-g2 are all valid.
	
	The minimum requirements to run the script are the region, biotype, and path to liftOver.
	
	The available <command(s)> are: "--makeHub" and "--getStats."
     
        Additional filter arguments can be passed alongside different commands for added specificity, including "--repeat," "--regulator," and "--felement." 
They must be comma-separated and either enclosed within double-quotes, where whitespace is allowed, or listed subsequently without whitespace in between commas.
     
	ACCEPTABLE:       --regulator "GATA1,CTCF,     SOX2"
                          --regulator GATA1,CTCF,SOX2
        UNACCEPTABLE:     --regulator GATA1, CTCF, SOX2
	
	The "--getStats" option can only be used on the results file(s) created by the GIGGLE search engine. The arguments are followed immediately after 
the <command> in a comma-separated fashion, as described above. They specify the path to the results file(s), as well as the variables to summarize and plot. 
Arguments and sample calls include:

      genes                          A list of the genes and their respective transcripts contained in the input region.
      cvgAbs                         The fraction of distinct bases from the input region covered by each major feature (exon, intron, intergenic, promoter, repetitive element, functional element, and cis-regulatory module). 
      cvgRel                         The fraction of distinct bases from the input region covered by each subcategory of major features. Exons are broken down into coding and noncoding, repetitive elements into their classes, families, and names, functional elements into their respective "genomic state", and cis-regulatory module into the corresponding transcription factor. Defaults to summarizing all major elements, but may be used in the form "cvgRel:<ele>," where <ele> corresponds to "ex," "rp," "fe,", or "crm" to output only individual breakdowns. 
      cvg:<ele1>-<ele2>              The fraction of distinct bases from element 1 <el1e> covered by overlapping elements 2 <ele2>
      
        ACCEPTABLE:       --getStats genes,cvgAbs,cvgRel
                          --getStats cvg:fe-crm
     
        If <command(s)> is omitted, the default behaviour of the program is to generate a set of "raw files" and the "giggle_files" directory for a given
region and biotype. The "raw files" include genome.bed (coding/noncoding exons, introns, intergenic regions), promoter.bed, repeat.bed, cr_module.bed, and f_element.bed, while the "giggle_files" is a directory tree of their breakdown into different categories and subcategories. These can be useful for customized manipulation 
to extract additional statistics or create more complex tracks via concatenation or application of external tools according to user needs.

Running genomeLabel
======

run.pl
------
This script makes calls and utilizes all other scripts and packages to generate labels, tracks, and summary statistics, depending on the user input.

makeHubs.pl
------
This script produces a directory named after the input region in the format **myHub_chr:start-stop**. It follows UCSC's [Public Hub Guidelines](http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/index.php/Public_Hub_Guidelines) by generating the following:
```bash
├── myHub_chrX:15200000-15800000 - directory containing track hub files
    ├── hg38 - directory containing hg38 (GRCh38) human assembly data
    |   ├── [...].bb - tracks in this directory
    |   └── trackDb.txt - display properties of tracks in this directory
    ├── genomes.txt - list of genome assemblies included in the hub (i.e. hg38 only)
    └── hub.txt - short description of hub properties
```
To use the output of *makeHubs.pl* in the UCSC Genome Browser, copy the complete hub folder (e.g. myHub_chrX:15200000-15800000) to a publicly accessible web server. Then, go to https://genome.ucsc.edu/index.html, click on My Data -> Track Hubs -> My Hubs, and add the link to your publicly available hub.txt file into the URL window.

Alternatively, you can load individual tracks from './out/chr:start-stop@biotype/tracks/<filter(s)>' as custom tracks on UCSC or IGV.

Example Data Tracks:
------
![Image #1 of Labelling Schema](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vQ51t4D1h96WMh588J429qSXkb_Fa6Cg_PhF3FHI4t2yPqMk1nzN0g54jFnf6wyD3hjs0qZS0brCaf3/pub?w=960&h=720)

This is an example of the priority levels behind the labelling of the **genome.bed** track, which is only one of the many tracks generated:
1. **genome.bed** - Coding/noncoding exonic, intronic, and intergenic elements
2. **promoter.bed** - Promoter elements
3. **repeat.bed** - Repetitive elements
4. **f_element.bed** - Putative cell-type-agnostic functional elements
5. **cr_module.bed** - Putative cell-type and transcriptional regulator-agnostic binding sites

![Image #2 of Labelling Schema](ucsc-v2-filter-tad.PNG)
![#Image #3 of Labelling Schema](ucsc-v2-filter-zoom.PNG)

These are examples of the difference between raw and filtered tracks. 
The commands used were **./run.pl chrX:15200000-15800000 --biotype gm12878 --path /home/bkirsh/** and **./run.pl chrX:15200000-15800000 --biotype gm12878 --path /home/bkirsh/ --repeat LINE,L2,SINE --regulator GATA2 --felement PromF,Tss.**
A filtered track was not created for cr_module.bed because there is no data for GATA2 in this biotype, which is verifiable by:
```bash
cat chrX:15200000-15800000@GM12878/tracks/GM12878/cr_module.bed | grep GATA2
```
Integration with GIGGLE:
------
In its default behaviour, genomeLabel produces the "giggle_files" directory, as exemplified below:
```bash
chrX:15200000-15800000/giggle_files
├── cr-module
│   └── factor
├── exon
│   ├── gene
│   └── transcript
├── f-element
│   └── state
├── intron
│   ├── gene
│   └── transcript
├── promoter
│   └── promoter
├── repeat
│   ├── class
│   ├── family
│   └── name
└── transcript
    ├── gene
    └── transcript
```
Each directory within the "giggle_files" directory tree corresponds to the different levels (e.g. repeat class, family, or name) or preferred labels (e.g. gene name or transcript name) for the different annotated bed files. As such, countless permutations of index and query files can be generated and applied by the GIGGLE tool. Detailed instructions and examples of how to run GIGGLE are available at https://github.com/ryanlayer/giggle.
Sample GIGGLE calls include:
```bash
mkdir split_sort
bash $GIGGLE_ROOT/scripts/sort_bed "split/*.bed" split_sort/ > /dev/null

$GIGGLE_ROOT/bin/giggle index -i "split2_sort/*gz" -o split_sort_b -f -s 2> /dev/null
```
Example Summary Statistics:
------
An important application of genomeLabel is that it allows users to visualize interesting overlapping elements on the genome browser, and revert back to using the tool in order to obtain coverage statistics.
**Gene feature statistics:** Summary information about the organization of the genetic region. Similar to [GeneBase 1.1](http://apollo11.isto.unibo.it/software/GeneBase/GeneBase_1.1.1_2019/GeneBase_Tutorial.html), this option outputs the median, mean, standard deviation, and total for many quantitative parameters associated with genes, gene transcripts and gene features (exons, introns, coding sequences, untranslated regions).

|Gene_Symbol|Coding_Status|Transcript_Count|RefSeq_Accession|Gene_Length(bp)|Transcript_Length(bp)|CDS_Length(bp)|UTR_Length(bp)|Coding_Exons_per_RNA|Noncoding_Exons_per_RNA|Introns_per_RNA

|Statistical_Summary|Gene_Count|Transcript_Length(bp)|CDS_Length(bp)|UTR_Length(bp)|Coding_Exons_per_RNA|Noncoding_Exons_per_RNA|Introns_per_RNA
Meadian(bp)
Mean(bp)
Standard_Deviation(bp)
Total(bp)

![Image #1 of Stats](stat-total.png)
![#Image #2 of Stats](stat-crm.png)
![#Image #3 of Stats](stat-fe.png)
![#Image #4 of Stats](stat-overlap.png)

Memory, Speed, and 'history.txt'
======
The 'history.txt' file is verified upon every call as a means to avoid requesting redundant data to the UCSC REST API. It consists of an ARRAY created using the Storable package, and stores two sets of HASHES - one made up of previous inputs and another one made up of previous bedFeature objects.
```bash
$VAR1 = [ { biotype => {chr => [ [ start , end ] ] } } , { source1 => [bedFeatures] , ... , sourceN => [bedFeatures] } ]
```
Should you encounter any problems with the generation of files that contain the correct information for your desired coordinates and filters, the issue most likely lies in "history.txt." Please delete the file and run the command again. While this will take longer, it will ensure that the output is correct.
